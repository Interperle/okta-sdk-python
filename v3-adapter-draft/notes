Dependency graph

Swagger:

Api -> ApiClient -> RestClient

Okta:

Resource Client -> RequestExecutor -> HttpClient

--------
Adapter:

Api -> ApiClientAdapter -> HttpClient
or
Api -> ApiClientAdapter -> RequestExecutor -> HttpClient
or
Api -> ApiClientAdapter(RequestExecutor) -> HttpClient
(ApiClientAdapter and RequestExecutor are the same object)

RequestExecutor is being used for pagination

Need to substitute models, resource clients, use ApiClientAdapter as entry point
